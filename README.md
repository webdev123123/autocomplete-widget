# autocomplete widget

This is mostly an experiment right now, but it may turn into something real.

Sorry for the bad docs right now. Gotta have dinner & a movie with my wife!

Basically just run the build, then open `index.html` in your browser. Styling needs to happen with regular css and classes. See the `src/` for that.

Good luck! So cool!
